## Bug Reporting :bug:

One of the most important things you can do is report bugs. Please reference [how to report a bug](http://polite.technology/reportabug.html) and follow the issue templates when adding new bugs.

## Development

- Most work happens in sub modules. These are found in the `packages` directory prefixed with "turf-".
- If you would like to propose a new feature, open an issue in Turfjs/turf.
- Always include tests. We use [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).
- Turf modules are small, containing a single exported function.
- GeoJSON is the lingua franca of Turf. It should be used as the data structure for anything that can be represented as geography.
- Avoid large dependencies at all costs.
- Turf is used in a wide range of places. Make sure that your code can run in the browser (ie: don't make calls to external services, don't hit the filesystem, etc.).
- The `README.md` files in `packages/turf-<module>` are automatically generated from the [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) of the `index.js`. Please modify the JSDocs instead of modifying the `README.md` files directly. Then update/create the `README.md` executing [`./scripts/generate-readmes`](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/blob/master/scripts/generate-readmes) or runing `npm run docs` from the root TurfJS directory.
- Finally run `npm test` from the project root folder to run all the tests required for deploying the project.

## Code Style

We have lots of tooling dedicated to ensuring consistent code. We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to help us deliver quality code. These are checked by the build system and should be enforced at commit time by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).

Some of the modules are written in Typescript, others are still plain Javascript. In the javascript modules and any dependencies we include, it is important to only write ES5 code. This ensures good browser compatability for Turf users, and is checked at build time.

Making sure that the monorepo packages can be managed at scale, we use [Monorepolint](https://github.com/monorepolint/monorepolint) which allows us to programatically manage the various files in each package.

## Structure of a turf module

```
turf-<MODULE NAME>
│   index.js
│   index.d.ts
│   bench.js
│   test.js
│   types.ts
│   package.json
│   README.md
│   LICENSE
│
└───test
    │
    ├───in
    │   points.geojson
    │
    └───out
        points.geojson
```
To get started with a new module navigate to the root directory and run
```sh
$ node ./scripts/create-new-module <MODULE NAME>
```
it will create a new folder inside `packages` with a simple boilerplate for your module.

* `index.js` - This file contains, in order, the various modules you need to
  import, the [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org) documentation, and, finally, the
  single exported function that the module provides. For more on the types
  supported in the documentation, see…
* `index.d.ts` - This is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) file
  that describes your function’s signature. For more on the types supported in
  TypeScript, see…
* `index.ts` - If you prefer to write Typescript instead of Javascript, use this
  instead of index.js and index.d.ts.
* `bench.js` - This file uses [Benchmark](https://benchmarkjs.com/) to time
  your function.
* `test.js` - This file includes your [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
  tests. We prefer dynamic testing built from GeoJSON files placed in
  `./test/in` that are subsequently written to `./test/out` if your `REGEN`
  [environment variable is set](https://askubuntu.com/a/58828) to `true`. If
  `REGEN` is set to a different value, then running `npm t` will compare the
  output of the tests to the files already present in `./test/out`.
* `types.ts` - A file that tests the custom TypeScript types declared in
  `index.d.ts`.
* `package.json` - The [node](http://nodejs.org) metadata container file.
  Modules imported in `index.js` should be listed here under `dependencies`,
  and modules used in `test.js` and/or `bench.js` should be listed under
  `devDependencies`. `npm install` looks to this file to install dependencies
  in `./node_modules`.
* `README.md` - This README is generated _automatically_ by running `npm run
  docs` from the project root level. **DO NOT edit this file**.
* `LICENCE` - Like the README, this file should not be edited.
* `test/` - This directory holds the GeoJSON files that provide data for
  dynamic tests (in `./test/in`) and the results of the tests (in
  `./test/out`). The files in `./test/out` should **not** be edited by hand.
  They should be generated dynamically by [setting the environment
  variable](https://askubuntu.com/a/58828) `REGEN` to `true`, and then the
  tests should be checked against these files by setting `REGEN` to some other
  value. The resulting out-files can be drag-dropped into
  [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) to see, visually, if the module is behaving
  appropriately.


## Publishing

### Prerelease

A [prerelease](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/blob/master/.github/workflows/prerelease.yml) action is available that publishes a canary release for every commit or PR merged to the master branch.  However, this action is only [enabled](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/actions/workflows/prerelease.yml) when needed.

When used, it publishes an alpha release to NPM (e.g. `7.0.0-alpha.116` where 116 is the number of commits to master since the last release tag).
- The version number is calculated by a combination of the output of `git describe` and the `publish:prerelease` script in the root package.json. Specifically having `major` is appropriate for the pre-7.0 development phase, but we should change it to `minor` after 7.0.0 is finally released.

### Release

Turf releases are a series of steps done from your local computer and on Github.  Be sure to start with a clean, up-to-date version of the Turf repository master branch.  When running the following release commands, replace `7.0.0` with the version number you are releasing.

- If necessary, make and merge a PR with any last minute housekeeping items.
  - Turf's documentation (README.md files) should be up to date as they are updated automatically on commit, based on the JSDoc comments in the package files.
- Review code commits and decide the new version number.  If there are breaking changes, then it should be a major version bump, e.g. 6.x.x to 7.0.0.  This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

- fetch the latest code from remote origin
```bash
git fetch origin
```

- create a release branch, replace mf with your initials to make it clear whose branch it is.
```bash
get checkout origin/master -b mf/release-7.0.0
```

- increment the version number of all packages, without pushing to origin.  This will also create a release tag.
```bash
pnpm lerna version --no-push 7.0.0
```

- stage changed files for commit
```bash
git add .
```

- create new commit on the release branch
```bash
git commit -m "Release v7.0.0"
```

- Push the release branch and the release tag.  The tag will trigger the Github [release](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) action which you can view the status of at - https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/actions.  If successful, a new [version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/turf?activeTab=versions) of all turf packages will have been published on NPM.
```bash
git push origin mf/release-7.0.0 --follow-tags
```

- If the release action was successful, create a Pull Request for the release and then merge it.
  - A link to create the PR should be in the output of the push command
  - Use the version number for the PR title (e.g. v7.0.0).
  - If a link isn't provided, just create a PR that merges your release branch to master.  Here is an example - https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/pull/2615.
  - Don't forget to merge your release PR!

#### Follow-on steps
- As part of the release action, a draft Github release will have been created at https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/releases with an auto-generated changelog.  Edit and add to the release notes for readability and completeness, specifically noting any breaking changes.  Use past releases as a guide.  Be sure to "Save draft" each time, then ask for a review from other contributors.  Once ready, click `Publish release`.  This will make the release notes publicly accessible and notify all watchers of the project.
- Snapshot and release a new version of the [API docs](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-www/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation

- Turf's documentation (README.md files) should be up to date in master as they are generated automatically on commit, based on the JSDoc comments in the package files. Should you need to, you can update them by running `npm run docs` and commit any changes.

README files are auto-updated To update TurfJS's Documentation (README.md) use the following `npm run docs`:
  - **inside a module:** will only generate the docs of that module.
  - **main folder:** will generate docs for all modules.

### Documentation - Examples

**Only builds docs for `@turf/center`**

```bash
$ cd ./turf/packages/turf-center
$ npm run docs

> @turf/center@5.0.4 docs /Users/mac/Github/turf/packages/turf-center
> node ../../scripts/generate-readmes

Building Docs: @turf/center
```

**Builds docs for all modules**

```bash
$ cd ./turf
$ npm run docs
> @5.0.0 docs /Users/mac/Github/turf
> node ./scripts/generate-readmes

Building Docs: @turf/along
Building Docs: @turf/area
Building Docs: @turf/bbox-clip
Building Docs: @turf/bbox-polygon
Building Docs: @turf/bbox
Building Docs: @turf/bearing
Building Docs: @turf/bezier-spline
Building Docs: @turf/boolean-clockwise
....
```

### Public website

[turfjs.org](http://turfjs.org/) is managed in a [separate repo](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-www) with its own [contributing guide](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-www/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Other Dependencies
- Turf uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) during the testing, packaging and publishing process.
  - Lerna and pnpm will be automatically installed when you run `npm install` in the root directory.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/turf).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
